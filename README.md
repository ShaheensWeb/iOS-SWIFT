A simple iOS app that is currently near naked in terms of graphical design. 
Currently waiting on some images from a digital media student friend of mine. 

What does this app do: Records user voice and adds four sounds effects;
->  sound effects 1-2(Slow effect + fast effect): Lower speed, and increase speed
    --> slower effect has speed set to 0.5, faster effect has speed set to 1.5 
-> sounds effects 3-4(Squeaky voice + deep voice): Higher pitch, and lower pitch. 
    --> Squeaky voice has frequency set to 1000, deep voice has pitch set to -1000 

Completed this application through following and completing the following Udacity course;
