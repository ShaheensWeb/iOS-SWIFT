A simple iOS app that is currently near naked in terms of graphical design. 
Currently waiting on some images from a digital media student friend of mine. 

What does this app do: Records user voice and adds four sounds effects;
sound effects 1-2(Slow effect + fast effect): Lower speed, and increase speed
sounds effects 3-4(Squeaky voice + deep voice): Lower frequency, higher frequency.

Completed this application through following and completing the following Udacity course;
